# MiTienda

This repository is dedicated to the duplication of Yelp. It utilizes the PERN stack (PostgreSQL, Express, React, and NodeJS). I followed the guidance of an online video, found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01rYl9T3BU">here</a>. It was a challenging project because of all the moving parts, but at the time that I completed this project it was helpful for my other project, <a href="http://www.github.com/elliottthomlison/micasa">MiCasa</a>. The YouTuber was extremely helpful in explaning things comprehensively, shoutout to him.
